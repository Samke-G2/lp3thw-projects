NOTES ON HOW TO READ CODE:

  1.  Functions and what they do.

  2.  Where each variable is first given a value.

  3.  Any variables with the same names in different parts of the program. These may be trouble later.

  4.  Any if-statements without else clauses. Are they right?

  5.  Any while-loops that might not end.

  6.  Any parts of code that you canâ€™t understand for whatever reason.


once you have all of this marked up, try to explain it to yourself by writing comments as you go.
Explain the functions, how they are used, what variables are involved and anything you can to figure this code out

on all of the difficult parts, trace the values of each variable line by line, function by function.
