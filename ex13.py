# Exercise 13 - Parameters, Unpacking, Variables

from sys import argv
# read the WYSS section for how to run this
script, first, second, third = argv

print("The script is called:", script)
print("Your first variable is:", first)
print("Your second variable is:", second)
print("Your third variable is:", third)


# Write a script that has fewer arguments and one that has more, use interesting names for the unpacked Variables

# Combine the use of input() with that of argv to make a script that gets more input from the user (in different ways)

# HAVE FUN DOING THIS, TAKE YOUR TIME...no rush.(name the new scripts like - ex13-1.py, ex13-2.py, ... you can even consider putting htem in a folder, but that just makes running htem harder, although it could help in practising how to nav in and out of a dir.)
